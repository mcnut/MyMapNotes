    <h1>MyMapNotes</h1>
    <p>MyMapNotes is a Universal Windows Application that allows a user to save notes about specific locations.</p>
    <p>It has been created for college coursework.</p>

    <h3>Project Requirements</h3>
    <p>The requirements for the project are Create a Universal Windows Project (UWP).
        <br>
        <ul>
            <li>Well-designed UI that is fit for purpose and provides a good user experience.</li>
            <li>Uses local/roaming storage for storing data and/or settings that are necessary for or enhance this user experience.</li>
            <li>Demonstrates appropriate use of the sensors/hardware available on UWP capable devices</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Accelerometer,</li>
                <li>gyroscope</li>
                <li>location services</li>
                <li>sound</li>
                <li>network service (connect to server for data)</li>
                <li>camera</li>
                <li>multi-touch gestures</li>
            </ul>
            <li>The app must be more than a simple information app. It must have interactivity as part of the design.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
        To fulfil the brief for this project I have decided to create MyMapNotes.
        <br> The basic application will use the device's local storage and location services.
        <br> It will also use a network service to connect to a server for data.
        <ul>
            <li>Users notes will be saved in local storage.</li>
            <li>The device's location services will be used to find it's location.</li>
            <li>The network service will be used to connect to google maps.</li>
        </ul>
        Once the basic application is working I intend to add more features.
        <br> I am considering connecting to an external weather API to allow the user access weather information about a given
        location.
        <br> Another option may be to use the device's camera and save photo's as notes.
        <br>
